        <h1>31 Nights of Fright</h1>
        <p>A fun exploration of horror movies.</p>
		<div>
		October is here, so in the spirit of Halloween me and my husband will be watching a horror movie each night. Since we're organized, obsessive people, we prepared a list for movies to watch.
We selected classics from the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th franchises and even some recent ones.  We mixed them up and prepared a nice calendar for the month of October.

This is the list of movies we are planning to watch this month:
